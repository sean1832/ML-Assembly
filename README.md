TimberAssembly is a research project that marries the power of Grasshopper and Unity to facilitate the generation of timber frame assemblies using reclaimed timber. This undertaking leans heavily on the capabilities of Unity's ML-Agent toolkit, employing a reinforcement learning agent to intelligently manipulate and modify a timber frame structure. The ultimate goal is to discover the optimal form that maximize the use of salvaged timber.
